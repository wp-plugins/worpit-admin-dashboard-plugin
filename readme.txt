== Description ==

[Worpit: All-New WordPress Administration Dashboard](http://worpit.com/?wordpressplugin)

**Worpit is not yet released. The product is still under active development - there is nothing to install yet!** 

Worpit lets you admin all your WordPress website from a single, fast, convenient dashboard.

No more logging in to each individual website to perform the same, repetitive tasks.

With Worpit, you can now:

*	Update the WordPress Core in bulk across all your websites
*	Update WordPress.org plugins in bulk across all your websites
*	Update WordPress.org themes in bulk across all your websites
*	Monitor the status of all plugins and themes in an easy to use dashboard.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is Worpit Free? =

Yes. Currently if you manage up to 3 WordPress websites you can use Worpit completely free.

= Is Worpit secure? =

Yes. We take great care to ensure the integrity of the connection between Worpit and your website.

All sensitive data is encrypted on our system so it is never human-readable by anyone.

= How does Worpit work? =

With the plugin installed and the connection setup to your own Worpit account, the Worpit system
will periodically ask your WordPress website for some information.  Currently we monitor:

*	WordPress Core update status
*	WordPress.org Plugins update status
*	WordPress.org Themes update status
*	Other server environment information that helps us to determine compatibility with the Worpit system.
This includes things like PHP version, HTTP server type and version. You can review all this captured
information from within Worpit and is useful as a handy reference.

= If Worpit is free why is there a payment option? =

If you have more than 3 Worpit sites, we consider you a professional/business user and contributing to 
the development of the Worpit product is a fair request.

= What is WorpDrive? =

WorpDrive is a new, [far more clever approach to WordPress backup and restore](http://worpdrive.com), 
and is a premium product available from with the Worpit control panel.

It doesn't use FTP, Amazon S3, or any of the traditional painful approaches to website backup, 
and you don't need to buy/rent any other 3rd party storage service.

WorpDrive is an ALL-IN-ONE backup and restore system for your WordPress website and is a bargain at twice the price.

= Is WorpDrive free? =

No. WorpDrive is available for a small monthly fee.
